## Goal

Using 'three-pass' approach to read papers.

## THE THREE-PASS APPROACH

### The first pass

<p><big> You can decide whether you need to do any more passes by first pass.</p></big>

&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Carefully read the **title**, **abstract**, and **introduction**.

&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Read the **section** and **sub-section** headings, but ignore everything else.

&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Glance at the **mathematical** content (if any) to determine the underlying theoretical foundations

&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Read the **conclusions.**

&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Glance over the **references**, mentally ticking off the ones you've already read.

<p><big>At the end of the first pass, you should be able to answer the *five Cs*:</p></big>

&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. *Category*: What type of paper is this? A messurement paper? An analysis of an existing system? A description of a research prtotype?

&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. *Context*: Which other papers is it related to? Which theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem?

&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. *Correctness*: Do the assumptions appear to be valid?

&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. *Contributions*: What are the paper's main Contributions?

&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. *Clarity*: Is the paper well written?

### The second pass

<p><big>In the second pass, read the paper with greater care, but ignore details such as proofs. It helps to jot down the key pints, or to make comments in the margins, as you read. Note down terms you didn't understand, or questions you may want to ask the author. </p></big>

1. Look Carefully at the figures, diagrams and other illustrations in the paper. Pay special attention to graphs. Are the eaxes properly labeled? Are results shown with error bars, so that conclusions are statistically significant? Common mistakes like these will separate rushed, shoddy work from the truly excellent.

2. Remember to mark relevant unread references for further reading.

<p><big>After this pass, you should be able to summarize the main thrust of the paper. You should be able to summarize the main thrust of the paper, with supporting evidence, to someone else. </p></big>

### The third pass
Not need for me now.
